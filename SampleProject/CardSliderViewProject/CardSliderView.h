// viewForCurrentCard is called on inital load, and is also used during transitions -
// it should return the card that we want to see when everything is settled after a transition.
- (UIView*)viewForCurrentCardForCardSlider:(CardSliderView*)slider;

// The following get called when the view is scrolled left or right.
// Implement all the logic for this however it makes sense in your application. (see sample implementation)
